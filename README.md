# COVID-19-LSTM-project
This project involves analyzing and predicting COVID-19 daily deaths using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.  The LSTM model forecasts future trends based on historical COVID-19 time series data, providing insights into potential future impacts. 

# COVID-19 Time Series Analysis and Prediction using LSTM

## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis and prediction of COVID-19 daily deaths using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The project also includes a Streamlit-based web application for visualizing and interacting with the predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing COVID-19 time series data.
- **LSTM Model**: Building and training an LSTM model to predict daily deaths.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Streamlit Web App**: Interactive dashboard for visualizing predictions.
